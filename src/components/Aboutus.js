<p>The story behind SADS
“When I was a kid, my mom used to donate clothes on my birthday. I used to wonder why we do this just once a year. I figured out that there is a gap between donors and NGOs as donors were not aware of the requirements of NGOs, had trust issues or were too busy to drive to the NGO. To fill this gap, SADS was born” – Anushka, Founder SADS India
